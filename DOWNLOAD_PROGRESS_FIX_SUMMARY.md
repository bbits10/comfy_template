- ✅ Better error handling and user feedback

## Usage

### Normal Operation

1. **Start Download:** Click download button for any model
2. **Monitor Progress:** Watch real-time progress with speed/ETA
3. **Refresh Safely:** Page refresh preserves all download status
4. **Multiple Downloads:** Track multiple downloads simultaneously

### Recovery Scenarios

1. **Page Refresh:** All active downloads automatically restored
2. **Browser Restart:** Downloads continue, status restored on reload
3. **Server Restart:** Previous status loaded from disk
4. **Stale Downloads:** Automatically detected and marked as errors

### Maintenance

1. **Clear Completed:** Use "Clear Completed" button to remove finished downloads
2. **Automatic Cleanup:** Downloads older than 24 hours auto-removed
3. **Status Check:** Visit `/status` endpoint for raw status data

## Testing

Use the test script to verify functionality:

```bash
bash /workspace/comfy_template/test_persistent_downloads.sh
```

**Manual Testing Steps:**

1. Start downloading a large model
2. Refresh the page during download
3. Verify progress bar reappears with correct status
4. Check active downloads section for details
5. Test multiple simultaneous downloads
6. Verify cleanup functionality
